<h2>Uniforms</h2>
<p>Art Modell, whose remarkable 43-year NFL career made him a regular finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, died Sept. 6, 2012 of natural causes at Johns Hopkins Hospital at the age of 87.
Stated former Ravens president David Modell, Art's oldest son:
"'Poppy' was a special man who was loved by his sons, his daughter-in-law Michel, and his six grandchildren. Moreover, he was adored by the entire Baltimore community for his kindness and generosity. And, he loved Baltimore. He made an important and indelible contribution to the lives of his children, grandchildren and his entire community. We will miss him."
As owner of both the Cleveland Browns (1961-1995) and the Baltimore Ravens (1996-2003), Modell directed teams that produced 28 winning seasons, 28 playoff games, two NFL Championships (1964 and 2000), three other appearances in NFL title contests (1965, '68 and '69), and four visits (1986, '87, '89 and 2000) to AFC Championships.</p>
